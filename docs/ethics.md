- Developing better evaluation metrics
- Creating more robust preprocessing pipelines
- Advancing explainable AI techniques

### üö´ Prohibited Uses

This system must NOT be used for:

‚ùå **Individual Assessment**
- Screening individuals for depression
- Making determinations about someone's mental health
- Influencing treatment decisions
- Crisis assessment or intervention

‚ùå **Automated Decision-Making**
- Employment or hiring decisions
- Insurance determinations
- Educational or academic evaluations
- Legal or judicial proceedings

‚ùå **Surveillance or Monitoring**
- Monitoring employee mental health
- Student mental health surveillance
- Social media monitoring for intervention
- Any form of covert psychological assessment

### üåç Bias and Fairness Considerations

#### Known Limitations
- **Cultural Bias**: Trained primarily on English-language data
- **Demographic Bias**: May not represent all populations equally
- **Temporal Bias**: Language and expression patterns change over time
- **Platform Bias**: Trained on specific social media contexts

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular model retraining with diverse data
- Ongoing bias testing across demographic groups
- Transparency about model limitations
- Human oversight in all applications

### üìä Data and Privacy

#### Training Data
- Uses publicly available tweet datasets
- No personally identifiable information should be included
- Data sources should be properly attributed
- Consider data subject consent and rights

#### User Privacy
- Do not collect or store personal information
- Implement appropriate data protection measures
- Provide clear privacy policies
- Allow users to control their data

### üî¨ Research Ethics

#### If Using for Research
- Obtain appropriate IRB approval
- Follow institutional research guidelines
- Respect participant rights and privacy
- Publish results responsibly with limitations clearly stated

#### Publication Guidelines
- Always include limitations and bias statements
- Provide clear guidance on appropriate use
- Include ethical considerations in methodology
- Make code and documentation available for scrutiny

### üÜò Crisis Resources and Support

If working with mental health data or if this work affects you personally:

#### Immediate Crisis Support
- **US**: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- **US**: Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- **UK**: Samaritans: 116 123

### üîß Technical Safeguards

#### Model Development
- Include uncertainty quantification
- Implement human-in-the-loop validation
- Use multiple evaluation metrics
- Test across diverse populations

#### Deployment Considerations
- Clear user interface warnings
- Prominent disclaimers
- Easy access to crisis resources
- Mechanisms for user feedback

### üìù Documentation Requirements

Any use of this system should include:

1. **Clear Purpose Statement**: What the system is intended for
2. **Limitation Warnings**: What it cannot and should not do
3. **Accuracy Metrics**: Performance limitations and confidence intervals
4. **Bias Acknowledgments**: Known biases and mitigation attempts
5. **Crisis Resources**: Links to appropriate mental health support
6. **Professional Guidance**: Encouragement to seek qualified help

### üîÑ Ongoing Responsibilities

#### For Developers
- Regular model auditing and retraining
- Monitoring for misuse or harmful applications
- Updating documentation as limitations are discovered
- Engaging with mental health professionals for guidance

#### For Users
- Using the system only for appropriate purposes
- Not making medical or personal decisions based on results
- Reporting potential issues or misuse
- Respecting privacy and consent of data subjects

## Conclusion

The development and use of AI systems for mental health applications carries significant ethical responsibilities. While these technologies offer exciting possibilities for research and understanding, they must be developed and deployed with extreme care, always prioritizing human welfare over technological advancement.

**Remember**: Technology is a tool to assist human judgment, never to replace it. In matters of mental health and human wellbeing, there is no substitute for qualified professional care, human empathy, and individual agency.
